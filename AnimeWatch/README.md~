AnimeWatch Player acts as Front End for mpv and mplayer. It is not full fledge frontend like smplayer, but it tries to incorporate many new features which are normally absent from any media player frontend designed for linux.

It tries to be a simple media manager for your audio and video collection with special emphasis on your anime collection, along with powerful playing capabilities of mpv and mplayer. You can organise your anime collection properly into various groups such as watching,incomplete etc.. You can create your own group also for any special category in the bookmark section.  It will also keep track of number of episodes that you have watched in a series. It will also manage history ,but you will have complete control over it.

 You can fetch fanart and posters from TVDB website. If proper match is not found then you can directly go to the website using inbuilt browser. In the inbuilt browser right click has been tweaked, so that when when you find relevant url of fanart ,poster or anime; you can directly right click on the option to save it as fanart or poster or find anime info. In the same way you can find Episode Names or thumbnails of the anime. If you are in Music section then you can use the inbuilt browser to get artist information and poster directly from Last.fm, if default perfect match is not found.

User can make as many playlists as possible. It is possible to merge various playlists and you can create playlist of both audio and video.

Users can see their entire collection in Thumbnail mode in Grid Layout, once your collection is ready with appropriate fanart or posters. Use this thumbnail mode if you have more than 2 GB of RAM. Otherwise your system may slow down. 

In thumbnail mode, Thumbnails of local video files are automatically generated with the help of 'ffmpegthumbnailer'.

In this player, a weak addon structure has been created, so that one can write addon for viewing video contents of various sites directly on this player, so that you don't have to deal with horrible flash player of the sites. Currently it supports certain anime sites. These extra addons are in the directory 'Plugins', which will be loaded once the application is started. These addons are optional and before using them please check copyright and licencing laws of your country. If viewing contents of these anime sites is not allowed in your country, then use it at your own risk. Author of the AnimeWatch player is not at all related to any of these anime sites. And these addons are also not core part of the player, they are completely optional.  After install, these addons will be in the directory
'~/.config/AnimeWatch/src/Plugins'. If your country does not allow viewing contents of these anime sites, then you can simply delete contents of the 'Plugins' folder.

Most of the above things are possible in KODI or Plex . But I wanted some simple player with either mpv or mplayer as backend with decent media management functionality and addon structure.

This player is made only for GNU/Linux systems.
It is developed mainly on Arch Linux and Tested on both Arch and Ubuntu 14.04.


Dependency:
(This player is mainly written pyqt)

python >= 3.5 
python-pyqt4 >= 4.11
python-requests
python-urllib3
python-pillow
python-beautifulsoup4
python-lxml
python-pip
python-pycurl
python-psutil
curl
wget
ffmpegthumbnailer
phantomjs
libnotify
pytaglib

jsbeautifier(optional: required for resolving certain links)
mpv or mplayer (having both is good option, for streaming video mpv is the best because it's seeking capability within live stream is very efficient and it's buffer management is also very good, and for listening music mplayer is very cost-effective. Cpu usage is just 1 to 2 % when playing music with mplayer. When playing local video files mplayer cpu utilization always remains 4-5 % point less than that of mpv atleast on my system)

In arch installation.

sudo pacman -S python python-pyqt4 python-requests python-urllib3 python-pillow python-beautifulsoup4 python-lxml python-psutil python-pip curl wget libnotify mpv mplayer phantomjs ffmpegthumbnailer sqlite3
(pytaglib is available in AUR but I preferred to install from pip)
sudo pip install pytaglib jsbeautifier

In ubuntu 14.04, default python points to python 2.7, hence for installing dependencies use following command

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt4 python3-requests python3-urllib3 python3-pil python3-bs4 python3-lxml python3-psutil python3-taglib python3-pip curl wget libnotify-bin mpv mplayer phantomjs ffmpegthumbnailer sqlite3

sudo pip3 install jsbeautifier (optional)

Once Dependencies are installed Download the folder. Goto AnimeWatch Directory. Open Terminal in the directory and use following command:
In Arch:
python install.py

In Ubuntu 14.04
python3 install.py
During Installation:
It will ask for root password for copying AnimeWatch.desktop file in directory “/usr/share/applications/” , so that application launcher can become visible in menu “Sound & Video”.
