First Remove or uninstall PyQt4 or PyQt5-WebKit version of the AnimeWatch. After uninstall either backup or remove '~/.config/AnimeWatch/src' directory, since it might contain incompatible Addons or plugins, because of which programme might not work.

Make sure qt5-webengine is installed.

Now In the 'AnimeWatch-PyQt5-WebEngine-Stable' directory open a terminal and run 'python install.py'. Now application launcher should be created in '~/.local/share/applications/' directory. If application launcher is not working, then directly go to '~/.config/AnimeWatch/src' directory, open terminal and run 'python -B animeWatch.py'.
